Pneumonia is a dangerous disease that may occur in one or both lungs usually caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria. In the traditional method, after taking x-rays doctors only can be able to say whether the x-ray scan has pneumonia or not which is a time-consuming and expensive process. To detect pneumonia disease efficiently from our mobile devices, I have developed an app where users can easily find whether they have pneumonia or not by uploading their X-Ray images on the app.
